export const title = `About me and technology`;

export const info = `Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase projects built with a
powerful combination of cutting-edge technologies such as React,
tanstack-query, Typescript, react-hook-form, Zod, Zustand, and
Tailwind CSS and Django Ninja (Python) for backend logic. 
This combination allows for quick handling of data between front-end and back-end.
Tailwind CSS and NextUI offers a highly
customizable and responsive design system, allowing for quick and easy
styling of components and enhancing the visual appeal of the projects.
Using these technologies together not only enhances the
functionality and performance of the applications but also simplifies
development, ensures data integrity, and provides a visual appealing.
Explore my portfolio to see firsthand how this
technology stack brings these advantages to life.`;

export const bio = `As a web developer, I contributed to the development of a digital
certificate generation system for Segurm√°tica, utilizing Sequelize's
ORM  and Typescript to define data models and interact with the database.
With Express.js, I crafted RESTful APIs and implemented controllers to
handle HTTP requests and responses. For client-side development, I employed React's state
management and event-driven architecture to create a user-friendly
interface. I leveraged React Hook Form for form state management,
TanStack Query for data fetching, and Zod for schema-based data
validation. Through this project, I gained experience
working with these technologies and improved my understanding of how
to integrate them to deliver a robust and efficient
application.`;
